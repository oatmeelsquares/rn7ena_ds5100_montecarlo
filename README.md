# rn7ena_ds5100_montecarlo
Final project for DS5100 F23

Author: Becky Desrosiers
Project title: Monte Carlo Simulator

## Synopsis
The package contains three (3) classes: Die, Game and Analyzer.

### import
Since there is only a single module, importing the package imports the module



Die objects are initialized with a numpy array reflecting the names of their faces (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) for a regular die. A Die object can have as many faces as you wish, and their weights will be automatically set to 1, but the Die can be made unfair using the change_weight method.
